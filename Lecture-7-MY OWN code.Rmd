```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r killme, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

churn = read.csv("~/Github/DSA1101 Slayers/datasets/churn.csv")

churn$Churned = as.factor(churn$Churned)
churn$Married = as.factor(churn$Married)
churn = churn[,-1]
attach(churn)

table(Churned)

prop.table(table(Churned))
```

## Generalised Linear Model: glm()

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
M1 <- glm(Churned ~ . , # . is all columns except the response col
          data = churn,
          family = binomial(link = "logit")) #logit is default tho
#note that Churned must be equal to 0 and 1, it can be as.factor(), but the category names MUST be 0 or 1. Ironically doesnt matter if you converted to factor, for glm.

#MUST specify family = binomial, bc its a 1 or 0 catagory.
#otherwise, linear model will be formed
summary(M1)
```

How to interpret coefficient of contact:

When the number of contacts increases by 1 unit, then the *log odds of churning* increases by [coefficient of contacts], keeping all other variables the same.

  => When the number of contacts increases by 1 unit, then the *odds of success changes by e^0.38 times* (or e^(coefficient of contacts) times), keeping all other variables the same
  
  
  
How to interpret married:

Comparing a married person (Married = 1) vs a non-married person, when other variables are the same, then the log odds of churning will be larger by 0.07.

  => Comparing a married person (Married = 1) vs a non-married person, then th odds of churning will change by e^0.07 times.

Remember that we want p-value to be as low as possible.

We see from the summary stats that the Pr(>|z|) value (ie the p value) for Cust_years is the highest, so lets drop it, and call the new model M2


```{r M2, echo=FALSE}
M2 <- glm(Churned ~ Age + Married + Churned_contacts,
          data = churn,
          family = binomial) #logit is default

summary(M2)
```

We see that the p value for married is still quiet large (0.331), so it is not that significant. Let's do another one lol

```{r M3, echo=FALSE}
M3 <- glm(Churned ~ Age + Churned_contacts,
          data = churn,
          family = binomial) #logit is default

summary(M3)
```

Note that the intercept might be not be significant, but usually keep the intercept in the model, so dont remove it unless removing it makes sense in the data context.

### ROC and AUC value for log model

log model calculates the probability of Y = 1 => more of a classifer
Remeber that AUC value is area under the ROC curve
```{r ROC curve, echo=TRUE}
library(ROCR)
#note model M3 is built using train = full dataset (row wise)
#so test the goodness of fit of the model by considering test = full dataset
prob = predict(M3, newdata = churn[,2:5], type = "response") #so newdata is just Age, Married, Churned. But honestly predict will just ignore Married cus M3 doesnt use Married. so no need to include it, its up to you.
#returns a vector of 8000 values

pred = prediction(prob, Churned)

roc = performance(pred, "tpr", "fpr")
auc = performance(pred, measure = "auc")

auc@y.values[[1]]
plot(roc , col = "red", main = paste(" Area under the curve :", round(auc@y.values[[1]] ,4)))
```

```{r plotting chaos, eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
alpha <- round (as.numeric(unlist(roc@alpha.values)) ,4)
length(alpha) 
fpr <- round(as.numeric(unlist(roc@x.values)) ,4)
tpr <- round(as.numeric(unlist(roc@y.values)) ,4)

cbind(alpha, tpr, fpr)
```

for churn data, delta is 0.24 [HELP NOO I NEED REVISIT THE LECTURE]
