# comments:

# WSS is greatly reduced when $k$ increases from 1 to 2. 
# Another substantial reduction in WSS occurs at $k = 3$.

# However, the improvement in WSS is fairly linear for $k > 3$.
# Therefore, the $k$-means analysis will be conducted for $k = 3$.

# The process of identifying the appropriate value of k is
# referred to as finding the ``elbow'' of the WSS curve
